# Microfrontends Implementation

This repository serves as a practice ground for implementing microfrontends architecture in web development.

## Overview

Microfrontends is an architectural style where a single web application is composed of multiple, smaller frontend applications. Each microfrontend is developed and deployed independently, allowing teams to work on different parts of the application with minimal coordination.

This repository provides examples, best practices, and resources for implementing microfrontends in your projects.
